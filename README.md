# Workshop introduction

The goal of the workshop is to introduce you to the world of Infrastructure as Code.

- create your own Terraform configuration files
- create infrastructure from scratch
- add new feature to your infrastructure (on-demand)
- destroy and recreate your infrastructure
- understand the concepts of providers, resources, provisioner, dependencies, variables

You can refer to [this page](prerequisites.md) to setup your environment if you haven't done so.

From now on, you can connect to the workshop bastion to have access to Terraform binaries. We have created work directories so you can track your work progress

  ssh -i 'my target directory'/id_rsa centos@10.55.201.122
  cd user<id>
